## Frontend

The frontend consists of an Ionic application. Node, Ionic, Yarn and Cordova are required in a global context.

Node installation is platform dependent. After Node installed:

`yarn add ionic cordova`

After cloning the repository, change directory into the project root, run:

`yarn`

then rename .env.example to .env and run

`ionic serve`

The backend application must be up and running in order to serve data.
